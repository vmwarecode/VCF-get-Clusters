The host, if intended to be used for a vSAN domain, should be vSAN compliant and certified as per the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide.

BIOS, HBA, SSD, HDD, etc. of the host must match the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide.

The host must have the drivers and firmware versions specified in the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide.

The host must have the supported version of ESXi (i.e 6.7.0-13006603) pre-installed on it.

The host must have a standard switch with two NIC ports with a minimum 10 Gbps speed.

The management IP must be configured to the first NIC port.

Ensure that the host has a standard switch and the default uplinks with 10Gb speed are configured starting with traditional numbering (e.g., vmnic0) and increasing sequentially.

Ensure that the host hardware health status is healthy without any errors.

All disk partitions on HDD / SSD are deleted.

The hosts, if intended to be used for vSAN domain must be associated with vSAN enabled network pool.

The hosts, if intended to be used for NFS domain must be associated with NFS enabled network pool.

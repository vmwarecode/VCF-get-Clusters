The host, if intended to be used for a vSAN domain, should be vSAN compliant and certified as per the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide.

BIOS, HBA, SSD, HDD, etc. of the host must match the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide.

The host must have the drivers and firmware versions specified in the VMware Hardware Compatibility Guide.

Ensure that the host hardware health status is healthy without any errors.

All disk partitions on HDD / SSD are deleted.

The hosts, if intended to be used for vSAN domain must be associated with vSAN enabled network pool.
